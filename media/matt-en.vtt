00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
student in the web development uh degree

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.480
and um right now I'm sitting in some

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.679
comfortable pajamas because it's been a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.280
pretty long day. But um you know I'm

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.560
going to talk about a little bit about

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.600
what I like um what I am am interested

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.680
development and uh design degree is the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.599
user research. I really do enjoy the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.440
idea of um understanding how to

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.440
implement processes that can help people

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.239
um have a greater experience when it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.840
comes to uh a digital sphere. I'm a huge

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.320
fan of technology and so I really like

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.480
video games. I play them often with my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.079

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.160

um listen to music and to listen to

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.320
audiobooks. Those are my kind of go-to

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.479
type of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.760
um

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.360
ways to relax when I'm out on the go or

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.320
when I'm doing homework or school work.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.720
And you know, yeah. Um that's pretty

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.680
