student in the web development uh degree and um right now I'm sitting in some comfortable pajamas because it's been pretty long day. But um you know I'm going to talk about a little bit about what I like um what I am  interested in. Uh my favorite part about the web development and uh design degree is the user research. I really do enjoy the idea of um understanding how to implement processes that can help people um have a greater experience when it comes to uh a digital sphere. I'm a huge fan of technology and so I really like video games. I play them often with my friends and um it's a great social um like outlet for me. I also really really like to um listen to music and to listen to audiobooks. Those are my kind of go-to type of ways to relax when I'm out on the go or when I'm doing homework or schoolwork. And you know, yeah. Um that's pretty much me. Um I really hope to get out of this class a passing grade. and um a greater understanding for how to use different medias on all web platforms
